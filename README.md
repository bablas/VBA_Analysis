# VBA_Analysis


Using VBA scripting we analyze real Stock Market Data

The Script will loop through each year of stock data and generate: 
    The total amount of volume each stock had over the year,
    Yearly Percentage change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was and
    Percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed
    
The Script will also Identify which Stock had "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest Total Volume" Throughout the year
